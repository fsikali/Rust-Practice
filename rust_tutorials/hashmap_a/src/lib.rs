/*
--- Storing Keys with Associated Values in HashMaps
- The type HashMap<K, V> stores a mapping of keys of type K to values of type V using a hashing
  function, which determines how it places these keys and values into memory.
- Many programming languages support this kind of data structure, but they often use a different
  name, such as hash, map, object, hash table, dictionary, or associative array.
- Hash maps are useful when you look into data not by an index, as you can with vectors but by using
  a key that can be of any type.
