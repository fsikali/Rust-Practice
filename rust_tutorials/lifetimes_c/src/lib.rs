/*
   Generic Lifetimes in Functions
    - Example: 

    - We'll write a function that returns the longer of two string slices.
    - This function will take two string slices and return a single string slice
    - After we've implemented the longest function, the code should print The
      longest string is abcd
    - We want the function to take slices, which are references, rather than strings, because
      we don't want the longest function to take ownership of its parameters.
